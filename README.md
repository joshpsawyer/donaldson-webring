# The Donaldsons Webring

## What is this?

Ah, the webring. Friends and like-minded people joining up to promote eachother
before search engines ruled everything. [Wikipedia Has A Great Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) but it
is sufficient to say that we're all artist friends that want to band together.

This particular webring is based on the [garlic garden Onionring](https://garlic.garden/onionring/) which can be viewed in its original form at the garlic garden onionring website. Some modifications were made to allow site names and descriptions.

## How do I join?

Contact somebody in the group that can vouch for you.

## What do I put on my site?

After joining the webring, simply paste the following on your website to render the widget.

```javascript
<div id='donaldsonwebring'>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://webring.joshpsawyer.com/onionring-variables.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://webring.joshpsawyer.com/onionring-widget.js"></script>
</div>
```

## Can I change the widget style?

Yes! The CSS for the widget comes from [onionring.css] but you can overload the styles on your website.
